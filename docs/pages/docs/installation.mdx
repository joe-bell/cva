# Installation

```sh
npm i class-variance-authority
```

  "Do I really have to write such a long package name for every import?"
</summary>

Unfortunately, yes. Originally, the plan was the publish the package as `cva`, but this name [has been taken and marked as a "placeholder"](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cva). I've reached out to the author and NPM support, but have yet to hear back.

In the meantime, you can always alias the package for your convenience…

## Aliasing

1. Alias the package with [`npm install`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-install)

   ```sh
   npm i cva@npm:class-variance-authority
   ```

2. Then import like so:

   ```ts
   import { cva } from "cva";

   // …
   ```

## Tailwind CSS

If you're a Tailwind user, here are some additional (optional) steps to get the most out of `cva`:

### IntelliSense

You can enable autocompletion inside `cva` using the steps below:

<details>

<summary>Visual Studio Code</summary>

1. [Install the "Tailwind CSS IntelliSense" Visual Studio Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)

2. Add the following to your [`settings.json`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings):

   ```json
   {
     "tailwindCSS.experimental.classRegex": [
       ["cva\\(([^)]*)\\)", "[\"'`]([^\"'`]*).*?[\"'`]"]
     ]
   }
   ```

</details>

<summary>Neovim</summary>

1. [Install the extension](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/server_configurations.md#tailwindcss)

2. Add the following configuration:

   ```lua
   lspconfig.tailwindcss.setup({
     settings = {
       tailwindCSS = {
         experimental = {
           classRegex = {
             "cva\\(([^)]*)\\)",
             "[\"'`]([^\"'`]*).*?[\"'`]",
           },
         },
       },
     },
   })
   ```

</details>

### Handling Style Conflicts

Although `cva`'s API is designed to help you avoid styling conflicts, there's still a small margin of error.

If you're keen to lift that burden altogether, check out the wonderful [`tailwind-merge`](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge) package.

For bulletproof components, wrap your `cva` component with `twMerge`.

<details>

<summary>
  Example with <code>tailwind-merge</code>
</summary>

```ts
import { cva, type VariantProps } from "class-variance-authority";
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge";

const buttonVariants = cva(["your", "base", "classes"], {
  variants: {
    intent: {
      primary: ["your", "primary", "classes"],
    },
  },
  defaultVariants: {
    intent: "primary",
  },
});

export interface ButtonVariants extends VariantProps<typeof buttonVariants> {}

export const button = (variants: ButtonVariants) =>
  twMerge(buttonVariants(variants));
```
