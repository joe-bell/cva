<summary>Do I really have to write such a long package name?</summary>

Unfortunately, yes. Originally, the plan was the publish the package as `cva`, but this name [has been taken and marked as a "placeholder"](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cva). I've reached out to the author and NPM support, but have yet to hear back.

In the meantime, you can always alias the package for your convenience…

1. Alias the package with [`npm install`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-install)

   ```sh
   npm i cva@npm:class-variance-authority
   ```

2. Then import like so:

   ```ts
   import { cva } from "cva";

   // …
   ```

## Tailwind CSS

If you're a Tailwind user, here are some additional (optional) steps to get the most out of `cva`:

### IntelliSense

You can enable autocompletion inside `cva` using the steps below:

<Tabs items={["Visual Studio Code", "Neovim"]}>
  <Tab>

    1. [Install the "Tailwind CSS IntelliSense" Visual Studio Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)

    2. Add the following to your [`settings.json`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings):

    ```json
    {
      "tailwindCSS.experimental.classRegex": [
        ["cva\\(([^)]*)\\)", "[\"'`]([^\"'`]*).*?[\"'`]"]
      ]
    }
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>

    1. [Install the extension](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/server_configurations.md#tailwindcss)

    2. Add the following configuration:

    ```lua
    lspconfig.tailwindcss.setup({
      settings = {
        tailwindCSS = {
          experimental = {
            classRegex = {
              "cva\\(([^)]*)\\)",
              "[\"'`]([^\"'`]*).*?[\"'`]",
            },
          },
        },
      },
    })
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Handling Style Conflicts

Although `cva`'s API is designed to help you avoid styling conflicts, there's still a small margin of error.

If you're keen to lift that burden altogether, check out the wonderful [`tailwind-merge`](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge) package.

For bulletproof components, wrap your `cva` component with `twMerge`.

<details>

<summary>Example with tailwind-merge</summary>

```ts
import { cva, type VariantProps } from "class-variance-authority";
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge";

const buttonVariants = cva(["your", "base", "classes"], {
  variants: {
    intent: {
      primary: ["your", "primary", "classes"],
    },
  },
  defaultVariants: {
    intent: "primary",
  },
});

export interface ButtonVariants extends VariantProps<typeof buttonVariants> {}

export const button = (variants: ButtonVariants) =>
  twMerge(buttonVariants(variants));
```
