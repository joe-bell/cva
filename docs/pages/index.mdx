# Class Variance Authority

[Get Started](/docs)

## Introduction

CSS-in-TS libraries such as [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/docs/variants) and [Vanilla Extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/documentation/) are **fantastic** options for building type-safe UI components; taking away all the worries of class names and StyleSheet composition.

…but CSS-in-TS (or CSS-in-JS) isn't for everyone.

You may need full control over your StyleSheet output. Your job might require you to use a framework such as Tailwind CSS. You might just prefer writing your own CSS.

Creating variants with the "traditional" CSS approach can become an arduous task; manually matching classes to props and manually adding types.

`cva` aims to take those pain points away, allowing you to focus on the more fun aspects of UI development.

  This project originally started out with the intention of merging into the wonderful [`clb`](https://github.com/crswll/clb) library, but after some discussion with Bill, we felt it was best to go down the route of a separate project.  
  I'm so grateful to Bill for sharing his work publicly and for getting me excited about building a type-safe variants API for classes. If you have a moment, please go and [star the project on GitHub](https://github.com/crswll/clb). Thank you Bill!
