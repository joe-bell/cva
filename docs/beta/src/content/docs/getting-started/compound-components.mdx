title: Compound Components
---

For larger, more complex components, you may end up wanting to create a set of composable components that work together: "Compound Components"

<details>
<summary>e.g. <code>&lt;Accordion.Subcomponent /&gt;</code> instead of <code>&lt;Accordion /&gt;</code></summary>

```tsx
import * as Accordion from "./Accordion";

function Example() {
  return (
    <Accordion.Root>
      <Accordion.Item>
        <Accordion.Header>Section 1</Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Content>Content 1</Accordion.Content>
      </Accordion.Item>
    </Accordion.Root>
  );
}
```

</details>

`cva` encourages you to build these compound components **with the power of CSS**; leverage the cascade, custom properties, `:has()` selectors, and moreâ€¦
