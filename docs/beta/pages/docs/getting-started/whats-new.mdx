# What's New?

`class-variance-authority` has moved to **`cva`**

## Changelog

### Enhancements

1. `class-variance-authority` → `cva`

1. **`cva` now accepts a single parameter**

   Base styles (whether `string` or `string[]`) are now applied via the named `base` property

   - _Before_

     ```ts
     import { cva } from "class-variance-authority";

     const before = cva("your-base-class");
     ```

   - _After_

     ```ts
     import { cva } from "cva";

     const after = cva({ base: "your-base-class" });
     ```

1. **No more `null`**

   Previously, passing `null` to a variant would disable a variant completely – to match Stitches.js – however this caused some [concern and confusion](https://github.com/joe-bell/cva/discussions/97).

   Instead, we now recommend [rolling your own `unset` variant](/docs/getting-started/variants#disabling-variants).

1. **Utilize `swc` minification to improve bundlesize**

   > **Warning**
   >
   > Size may differ before stable release

1. Warns against passing generic type parameters into `cva`. This wasn't supported originally, but the API wasn't exactly clear.

### Features

1. **New `compose` API**

1. **New `defineConfig` API**
