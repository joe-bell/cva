What's changed since `class-variance-authority@0.*`?

## Features

### 1. `compose`

Shallow merge any number of cva components into a single component via the new [`compose` method](/docs/getting-started/composing-components).

### 2. `defineConfig`

Extend `cva` via the new [`defineConfig` API](/docs/api-reference#defineconfig).

Want to use `cva`/`cx` with `tailwind-merge`? [No problem](/docs/getting-started/installation#handling-style-conflicts)!

## Enhancements

### 1. `class-variance-authority` → `cva`

One of the biggest – and let's be honest, most important – complaints about `class-variance-authority` was that the name was just too damn long.

Shout-out to GitHub for transferring `npm` ownership of `cva`!

### 2. `cva` now accepts a single parameter

Base styles are now applied via the named `base` property.

- _Before_

  ```ts
  import { cva } from "class-variance-authority";

  const before = cva("your-base-class");
  ```

- _After_

  ```ts
  import { cva } from "cva";

  const after = cva({ base: "your-base-class" });
  ```

### 3. Goodbye `null`

Previously, passing `null` to a variant would disable a variant completely – to match the behaviour of Stitches.js – however this [caused a great deal of confusion](https://github.com/joe-bell/cva/discussions/97).

Instead, we now recommend explicitly [rolling your own `unset` variant](/docs/getting-started/variants#disabling-variants).

### 4. Clearer Type Guards

`cva` uses generic type parameters to infer variant types, but this was often confused as something that could be customized.

If you attempt to pass a generic type parameter, `cva` will now throw an error.

### 5. Minification

A tiny enhancement, but a nice boost to bundlesize.
